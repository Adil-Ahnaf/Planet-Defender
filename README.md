## Game Story
In a distant galaxy, a peaceful planet is under constant threat from an onslaught of rogue asteroids. The planet’s inhabitants have placed their trust in a powerful defense system known as **“Planet Defender”** to shield them from imminent destruction. The player takes control of this defense system, responsible for aiming and firing at the asteroids. Each level brings a wave of increasingly dangerous asteroids, including larger and faster ones. With each stage, the player edges closer to saving the planet or witnessing its destruction.


## Game Rule
- Destroy all incoming asteroids before they collide with the planet.
- Players use a fixed cannon to aim and shoot at incoming asteroids from all directions.
- Points are awarded for each asteroid destroyed.
